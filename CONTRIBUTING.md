üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Feature Hunt. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

See the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/shahrk/feature-hunt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) of the original [feature-hunt](https://github.com/shahrk/feature-hunt) if you plan to contribute upstream from this fork.

# How to Contribute?

## Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Alternatively, you can open a new discussion here: https://github.com/CSC510-Group-25/feature-hunt/discussions/categories/bugs

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut, and if so which one?
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. 
* If you encounter a bug in a specific branch, please note the branch name.

**Do NOT report a bug on a specific file, line of code, or test case if the file, code, or test case in question is not present anywhere in the repository.**

## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as Github issues. After you have determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information.

* Use clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples as Mardown code blocks.
* Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users and is not something that can or should be implemented as a community package.
* List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.
* Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.
